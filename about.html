<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Allow me to introduce myself - I am Harmanpreet Singh, a student currently enrolled at PEC Chandigarh. My educational journey began at the esteemed Delhi Public School in Chandigarh, where I developed a strong foundation for my future endeavors. I firmly believe in the power of embracing the cards we are dealt with.
Beyond my academic pursuits, I find great joy in being a sport enthusiast and curating memes. Sports fuel my passion for competition and teamwork, while curating memes allows me to explore my creative side and bring laughter to others. It's important for me to keep exploring, adapting and, above all, spreading love to everyone around me.
